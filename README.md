# Traffic-Education-Game-Code
This is my thesis project, it is a game that was developed using Unity and its goal is to educate children of smaller ages on the traffic matters.  It is equipped with an SQLite database that is used for registration and login purposes, plus some database analysis on the scores of the user. The analysis is then used to switch the focus on areas that the user lacks knowledge and also make the application meet each user's needs. In this repository exists the code that was writen while creating the game.
